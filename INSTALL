TODO: something better should be here.

For now, I can just tell you that fb_text2screen uses CMake.
So, in order to build fb_text2screen, you need to install cmake.
Refer to your distro docs on package installation.
Gentoo users: emerge cmake

1) Create an empty directory and cd into it.
2) Run `cmake /path/to/fb_text2screen/dir/`.
That'll generate a makefile and various cmake helper things.
3) Run `ccmake .` and configure build options.
4) Now, `make` to compile fb_text2screen sources and `make install` to install it to your fs.

Attention, CMake doesn't support `make uninstall`
